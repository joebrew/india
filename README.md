## Meeting notes

### 2018-01-07

#### 9:00 BMGF Delhi

##### Opening Discussion

- Peter: Overall agenda is: fly to Patna today, WHP meeting, dinner; tomorrow will be a bit more formal (Q+A); Back to Delhi Wednesday night; Thursday meeting with incredible group of people; Friday/Saturday totally open at this point.
- CK: The value of this is getting the mix of disciplines/languages/backgrounds together.
- CK: If we moved forward with a tracer, what would it take on the tech side to make this happen?
- CK: On Friday, we talk about _how_ a solution looks, practically (ie, next steps).
- CK: Strategic Investment Fund of the Foundation doesn't make grants but does make equity investments. End of month possibility of working together.
- John: Tech is easy, culture/policy is hard. I want to get a sense of these issues.
- Keith: I would like to speak to people at all pieces (ie, from beginning of process to end), high and low on food chain.
- Iulian: Many companies are not even known, but have > 50% market penetration.
- Peter: Let's remember - the people we're talking to have tech exhaustion.
- Peter: Let's explore the long-term, not the next few months.
- Puneet: There is a lot of concern from different parties - "What are you all doing here?". Let's be cautious/respectful with the agenda. We're not trying to colonize India's ICT. There is ample precedent for people walking in and saying "I have the solution, show me the problem".

Discussion:

- Peter: There is tremendous volume of resource, but it is not "fungible".
- Puneet: We will see 2 projects in Patna. One is vertical, well-funded; other is smaller, more comprehensive.
- Peter: The challenge is not TB; the challenge is health care delivery.
- Peter: We are here for TB, but we're open to talk about the bigger problem.

  - People very price elastic - not willing to pay more
